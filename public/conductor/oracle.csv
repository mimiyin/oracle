Are you coming,Do you feel hunger,Are you crying,Is it time
Are you going,Will we all be okay,Are you hiding,"Are you thinking, it's time now"
Are you leaving,Is the world ending,Do you want to hide,Are you done
Are you lying,Are you worried that the world is ending,Are you alright,Are you beginning
Are you trying to tell me something,Is a life partner necessary,Are you giving in,Did you find what you were looking for
Have you been lying,Are we all doomed,Are you resting,Are you following
Do you want to go,Are you hungry,Do you want to give in,Are you first
Do you want to rest,Are you thinking we're all doomed,Would you like to give in,Are you last
Do you want to pause,Has it begun,Have you already given in,Did you want to be in the middle
Do you want to stop,Will it go on,Have we gone too far,Did you find the inevitable
Do you want to stay,Are you worried about something,Is it too much,Are you starting over
Are you walking away,Is it beginning,Is it too little,Are you starting where you left off
Do you want to walk away,Do you want to sit,Are we overdoing it,Did you end up where you started
Is this real,Would you like to sit,Aren't we a bit past it at this point,
,Aren't you rushing things a bit,Is it over,

,,Aren't we done now,
,,Isn't it over,
,,Doesn't it matter,
,,Isn't this real,
,,Isn't there a point,
,,Aren't you going too far,
,,Do you want to let it go,
,,Are you ready to let go,
,,Are you letting go,
